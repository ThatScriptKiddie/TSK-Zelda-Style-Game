# TSK-Zelda-Style-Game
A game very similar to Zelda
I don't care how many times I am asked, I will not be uploading the files of my game.
This is for 2 reasons.
1. The game is so much similar to Minish Cap, that I feel like I would be ripping Nintendo off.
2.  The game will without a doubt be too buggy and the controls are going to be too weird for anyone to play.

The only reason I am making this repo is so I can keep track of my progress.
