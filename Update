I have 2 things to announce.

1:
Progress has almost completely halted. The PC I was using's motherboard is dead. 
That PC had a 1080 TI, 16gb of RAM, a Ryzen 5 3600, and a 512gb ssd so it was great for this project.
All I have now, is a 2011 Macbook Pro that can barely run Unity and Visual Studio at the same time, so I installed Bolt.
After using Bolt, I found that visual vcripting is a lot more intuitive for people like me, so I'll probably be using Bolt from this point on.

2:
Progress is also slowing because I am starting to get very busy. School is getting harder and harder and I need to devote more time to it.
I also need to get a job so I can buy a new motherboard and possibly some hardware upgrades.
