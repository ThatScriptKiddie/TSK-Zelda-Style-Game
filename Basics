I have the bare basics of my 2D Zelda Style game done.
The graphics somewhat ressemble Minish Cap.
Aside from graphics I have also made a test map to help me get the movement, fighting, and item usage perfect.
I still have lots to do. I have to make an entire map for the game.
I have to create a story. I have to cde in a bunch of NPCs. And there are loads more to do.
After this project is done I want to create a Wind Waker style game since I really like Cel Shaders.
Well, I better get back to work. As always I will keep you all updated.
